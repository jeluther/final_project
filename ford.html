            <p> This page is dedicated to the birth and development of Ford. Although this page is currently quite bare, it will later contain 
                more about the history of Ford as a company, as well as a gallery showcasing some of Ford's most iconic models.
            Please bear with us until this page can be fully completed. </p>

            <h2> 
                <p> The Ford Motor Company is an American Company founded in Detroit in 1896. The Ford motor company is 
                    a large part of why Detroit was nicknamed "Motor City". One of the most popular original models
                of the vehicle is the Model T, introduced in 1998. </p>

                <p> It is important to note that the Ford Motor company does not endorse the views of its founder, Henry Ford.
                    Although many only know Henry Ford for his cars or his use of the assembly line, he was also largely known for 
                publishing anti-semitic articles in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent. Today's company is largely divorced from
            those views. </p>
                
                <p> The Ford F-series is the most popular Ford line of all time, selling over 14 million vehicles. 
                    These light-duty trucks have been in production since 1948.
                </p>

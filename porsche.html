                <h1> About Porsche</h1>

                <p> Porsche was founded in 1948 with the creation of the Porsche Type 356. The initial thinking behind Porsche was taking the already established Volkswagen concept and add a luxurious twist. 
                However, the concept of Porsche can be traced all the way back to 1930, when Ferry Porsche and others started putting their stamp on the automotive world. 
                The Porsche team began work on the Type 22 mid-engine P race car in 1933. 
                The Porsche name has become synonymous with sports cars and racecars because that is what company founders Ferdinand Porsche and his son Ferdinand ("Ferry") set out to build when they first set up shop with 200 workers in 1948. 
                The aspect of Porsche that stood out was its unprecedented comfort and reliability which was unparalleled in the sports car industry to that point. </p>

                <p> Potentially Porsche's most iconic and successful line was introduced in 1964, when the 911 made its debut. 
                The rear-engine 911 included models such as the S, Turbo, Cabriolet, and Carrera. Porsche is also synonymous with racing. 
                To date, Porsche cars have won an estimated 24,000 auto races around the world, including more than 50 class wins at Le Mans. </p>
                
                <p> In 1954, Porsche introduced the Speedster model as low-priced, "stripped-down" version of 356. Today the 1954-1957 Speedsters are among the most sought-after Porsches by collectors. 
                Porsche built it's 10,000th vehicle in 1956. In 1964, 911 production begins, and the new model is an instant hit with a price of $5,500 for potential buyers. 
                In 1975, Porsche introduces the 911 Turbo supercar in North America as a 1976 model. The 911 Turbo combines exotic car performance with luxury and everyday usability. 
                In 1978, Porsche releases it's first ever front-engine model in the 928 which would ultimately be discontinued in 1995. </p>

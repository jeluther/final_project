What's up Daniel, I'm missing Discussion this morning but wanted to share some information with you. I've already sent you a couple emails. 
I worked on the project a lot this past weekend and have what we need to do for homework 8 essentially done (with the header and footer stuff). 
Feel free to steel that and add it to the two html files that you will be making. If I'm in class tomorrow we can talk more then. Otherwise we can next week!
Also, please text me so that I have your number. Mine is 248-983-7234. Have a great day

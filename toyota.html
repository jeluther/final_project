            <p> This page is dedicated to the birth and development of Toyota. On this page we explore the history of this multinational automotive manufacturer.
                You will also find various images of some of Toyota's most popular and iconic vehicles from throughout their history. </p>

            <h2> 
                <p> Toyota, originally named Toyoda, began constructing automobiles in 1936 in Japan. Their original models were inspired 
                    by the designs of Chevrolet and Dodge vehicles that the founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, saw while visting the United States. </p>

                <p> Toyota cars are well-known for their durability. According to one commercial by the company (found here), approximately 80%
                    of Toyota vehicles that were produced 20 years ago are still on the road. Due to their long-lasting nature, Toyota's customers
                know that they are purchasing a vehicle they can rely on. </p>
                
                <p> One vehicle line of particular note is the Toyota Corolla. Since the first one released in 1966, over 50 million Toyota Corollas 
                    have been sold, This makes the Toyota Corolla one of, if not the most, popular cars of all time. Of course, the 
                line has come a long way since the 60s. The 2023 Toyota Corolla will contain features such as a smart key system, a pre-collision 
            system with pedestrian detection, and steering assist for lane departures. </p>

            <p class="Bugatti_Type57SC"> Many consider this the first supercar ever built, with a maximum speed of 123 MPH. 
                Only 4 of these cars were ever created and 3 of those cars are still in existence, with the 4th being missing for over 80 years.

            <img class="horizontal" class="Ferrari_250" src="images/1961_Ferrari_250.jpg" alt="Image of a 1961 Ferrari 250 GTO" />
            <p class="Ferrari_250"> This Ferrari was designed to be a racecar that also met regulations in order to be classified street legal. 
                The first prototype was raced in the Daytona Continental and took 4th place in 1962. 
                A total of 39 models were manufactured by Ferrari. </p>

            <p class="Dodge_Charger"> The 1970 Dodge Charger RT is a classic car that is popular among TV shows and movies.
                The list of cinematography in which the Charger makes an appearance includes but is not limited to Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, The Fast and the Furious, and Dukes of Hazzard. 
                The base price back in 1970 was only $3,700. The car boasted 350 base horsepower from a 440 cubic-inch Magnum V-8. </p>

            <img class="horizontal" class="Corvette_Stingray" src="images/1976-chevrolet-corvette-stingray.jpg" alt="Image of a 1976 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray" />
            <p class="Corvette_Stingray"> The 1976 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray may be the most classic Corvette ever produced. 
                There were a little over 46,000 units produced with a starting price of $7,604.85. 
                The 1976 Corvette featured various minor exterior edits in comparison to the prior year's model. 
                Updates that included the re-introduction of the aluminum wheels, removing the air-extractor vents from the rear deck, 
                removing the cowl flap from the hood, and introducing two different styles of rear bumper. </p>

            <img class="horizontal" class="Bugatti_Veyron" src="images/Bugatti_Veyron.jpeg" alt=" Image of a 2012 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport" />
            <p class="Bugatti_Veyron"> This is the world's fastest production convertible. This car is stocked with a quad turbocharged and intercooled DOHC 64-valve W-16 engine. 
                It can reach a top speed of over 248 mph and 0-60 in less than three seconds. It also sports an extremely luxurious interior. 
                I had the opportunity to see one parked on the street in Beverly Hills. </p>

            <h3 class="Ferrari_F40"> 1987 Ferrari F40 </h3>
            <img class="horizontal" class="Ferrari_F40" src="images/Ferrari_F40.jpg" alt="Image of a 1987 Ferrari F40" />
            <p class="Ferrari_F40"> This is a mid-engine rear-wheel drive Ferrari that was designed as a celebration of 40 years of Ferrari. 
                The Ferrari F40 was the last Ferrari vehicle that was personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. 
                With this approval came a car that was the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive vehicle for sale when it was produced. 
                There were 1,311 Ferrari F40 models produced with less than 250 of those being shipped to the United States. 
                The original price of the F40 was $399,150, however, on average, purchasing one of these vehicles today will run its purchaser $1.5 million. 
                This model was regarded as the first 200-mph production car, the F40 rocked a 2.9L twin-turbo V8 engine, generating 471 hp and 426 lb-ft of torque. </p>


            <h3 class="Ford_GT40"> 1964 Ford GT40 </h3>
            <img class="horizontal" class="Ford_GT40" src="images/Ford_GT40.jpg" alt="Image of a 1964 Ford GT40" />
            <p class="Ford_GT40"> The second oldest Ford GT40 was most recently sold at auction for s hefty 7 million. 
                The whole reason this car was created was the purpose of dethroning Ferrari from dominating endurance racing in Europe. 
                This car came equipped with a top speed just shy of 200 MPH. This automobile supported a mid-engine design with rear wheel drive. 
                There were only 111 Ford GT40's ever produced. </p>


            <h3 class="McLaren_F1"> 1997 McLaren F1 GT </h3>
            <img class="horizontal" class="McLaren_F1" src="images/McLaren_F1.png" alt="Image of a 1997 McLaren F1 GT" />
            <p class="McLaren_F1"> The McLaren F1 GT features a mid V-12 engine and a carbon fiber chassis frame. 
                The driver seat is also mounted in the center of the vehicle. It was the world's fastest production car for 12 consecutive years, 
                topping out at 240.1 mph. McLaren only built three examples of the F1 GT in 1997. 
                In comparison to the previous model, this version included a much longer nose and rear sections, wider fenders, a spoiler integrated into the rear fascia, and a bigger wing. 
                The upgrades increased downforce and reduced drag, making the F1 faster than it's ancestors. 
                One of the GT's sold for over 1 million dollars back in the 90's. </p>


            <h3 class="Pagani_Huayra"> 2011 Pagani Huayra </h3>
            <img class="horizontal" class="Pagani_Huayra" src="images/Pagani_Huayra.jpg" alt="Image of a 2011 Pagani Huayra" />
            <p class="Pagani_Huayra"> This is personally, my favorite supercar to exist. I believe it's aesthetic is second to none. 
                This supercar uses a Mercedes-sourced V12 engine and takes advantage of Pagani's in-house carbon fiber expertise. 
                This car was named after the god of wind, Aymara Huayra Tata. 
                The Pagani Huayra is a coup√© with 2 doors and a mid-mounted engine which transmits its power through the rear wheels. </p>


            <h3 class="Shelby_Cobra_427"> 1967 Shelby Cobra 427 </h3>
            <img class="horizontal" class="Shelby_Cobra_427" src="images/shelby-cobra-427.jpg" alt="Image of a 1967 Shelby Cobra 427" />
            <p class="Shelby_Cobra_427"> In additional to the competition cars, 260 of these units were produced as street-legal variants. 
                One of these vehicles could go from zero to 60 mph in about 4.3 seconds, and to 100 mph in 8.8 seconds. 
                The most a single buyer has paid for one of these cars is $13,750,000. 
                The high-performance race car components of the car lead made the street-legal version of the car very hard to control. </p>
